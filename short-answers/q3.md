# Question
What's the difference between `.innerText` and `.textContent`?

# Answer
`.innerText` grabs the text inside whatever element you're targetting (excluding any hidden or styled text), while `.textContent` grabs all text-based content in the element you're targetting (including attributes, comments, etc.)

# Teacher Feedback

Yes, basically anything that is visible to user could be accessed by `.innerText` whereas anything seen by dev could be accessed by `.textContent`! You misspelled **targeting**!
