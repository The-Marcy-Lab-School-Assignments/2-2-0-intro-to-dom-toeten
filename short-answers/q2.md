# Question
Watch [this video on nodes and elements](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhvec8cXLlo)

What is the difference between an HTMLCollections and NodeLists? Are they arrays?

# Answer
HTMLCollections are collections of only the HTML elements. NodeLists return all of the nodes in the HTML (nodes include anything within the HTML document such as text, comments, elements etc). Neither are arrays, but they are array-like and behave some-what similarly to arrays.
